	* gromit.c: - Use XGrabKey to grab the "Pause" key of the keyboard.
	Use it to control gromits functionality. The selection-hack is no
	longer needed (but still available).

	* gromit.c: - Applied a (slightly modified) patch from
	Bastien Nocera (hadess@hadess.net) to port gromit to GTK+ 2. Still
	needs some testing with a Tablet.
	- removed deprecated stuff
	- changed the activation of input devices, having mice as extended
	input devices apparently confuses GDK.

	* gromit.c: Make sure that the arrowhead is connected to the line.
	Draw black outline around the arrowhead.
	Have just one global last coordinate. Tackles some problems when
	switching tools while drawing.
