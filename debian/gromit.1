.SH NAME
Gromit \- Presentation helper to make annotations on screen
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gromit
.RI [ options ]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBGromit\fP enables you to make annotations on your screen. It can run in
the background and be activated on demand to let you draw over all your
currently running applications. The drawing will stay on screen as long as you
want, you can continue to use your applications while the drawing is visible.
.br
\fBGromit\fP is XInput-Aware, so if you have a graphic tablet you can
draw lines with different strength, color, erase things, etc.
.br
Since you typically want to use the program you are demonstrating and
highlighting something is a short interruption of you workflow,
Gromit is activated by either a hotkey or a repeated invokation of Gromit
(the latter can e.g. used by other applications or your windowmanager).
.br
.SH KEYBOARD CONTROL
By default, Gromit grabs the "Pause" key (this can be change using the
"--key" option), making it unavailable to other application. The
available shortcuts are:
.TP
.B Pause
toggle painting
.TP
.B SHIFT-Pause
clear screen
.TP
.B CTRL-Pause
toggle visibility
.TP
.B ALT-Pause
quit Gromit
.PP
.SH OPTIONS (STARTUP)
A short summary of the available commandline arguments for invoking Gromit, see
below for the options to control an already running Gromit process:
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-active
start Gromit and immediately activate it.
.TP
.B \-k <keysym>, \-\-key <keysym>
will change the key used to grab the mouse. <keysym> can e.g. be
"Pause", "F12", "Control_R" or "Print". To determine the keysym for
different keys you can use the \fBxev\fP(1) command. You can specify "none"
to prevent Gromit from grabbing a key.
.TP
.B \-K <keycode>, \-\-keycode <keycode>
will change the key used to grab the mouse. Under rare circumstances
identifying the key with the keysym can fail. You can then use the keycode
to specify the key uniquely. To determine the keycode for different keys you
can use the \fBxev\fP(1) command.
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-debug
gives some debug output.
.SH OPTIONS (CONTROL)
A sort summary of the available commandline arguments to control an already
running Gromit process, see above for the options available to start Gromit.
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quit
will cause the main Gromit process to quit.
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-toggle
will toggle the grabbing of the cursor.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-visibility
will toggle the visibility of the window.
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-clear
will clear the screen.
.SH BUGS
Gromit may drastically slow down your X-Server, especially when you draw
very thin lines. It makes heavily use of the shape extension, which is
quite expensive if you paint a complex pattern on screen. Especially
terminal-programs tend to scroll incredibly slow if something is painted
over their window. There is nothing I can do about this.
.br
Gromit partially disables DnD, since it lays a transparent window across
the whole screen and everything gets "dropped" to this (invisible)
window. Gromit tries to minimize this effect: When you clear the screen
the shaped window will be hidden. It will be resurrected, when you want
to paint something again. However: The window does not hide, if you
erase everything with the eraser tool, you have to clear the screen
explicitly with the "gromit --clear" command or hide Gromit with
"gromit --visibility".
